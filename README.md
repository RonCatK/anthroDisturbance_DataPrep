# Overview  

This is a data preparation module to harmonize different anthropogenic disturbance datasets. It's primarily intended for the Northwest Territories region (default), but the structure is universal. All needed is the metadata information required by the `disturbanceDT` object (a `data.table`) and it generates the list (general category) of lists (specific class) needed for generating disturbance layers.
